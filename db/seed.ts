    description: "A list of practical projects that anyone can solve in any programming language (See solutions). These projects are divided into multiple categories, and each category has its own folder.  To get started, simply fork this repo.  CONTRIBUTING See ways of contributing to this repo. You can contribute solutions (will be published in this repo) to existing problems, add new projects, or remove existing ones. Make sure you follow all instructions properly.  Solutions You can find implementations of these projects in many other languages by other users in this repo.  Credits  Problems are motivated by the ones shared at:   Martyr2\u2019s Mega Project List Rosetta Code Table of Contents Numbers Classic Algorithms Graph Data Structures Text Networking Classes Threading Web Files Databases Graphics and Multimedia Security Numbers Find PI to the Nth Digit - Enter a number and have the program generate PI up to that many decimal places. Keep a limit to how far the program will go.  Find e to the Nth Digit - Just like the previous problem, but with e instead of PI. Enter a number and have the program generate e up to that many decimal places. Keep a limit to how far the program will go.  Fibonacci Sequence - Enter a number and have the program generate the Fibonacci sequence to that number or to the Nth number.  Prime Factorization - Have the user enter a number and find all Prime Factors (if there are any) and display them.  Next Prime Number - Have the program find prime numbers until the user chooses to stop asking for the next one.  Find Cost of Tile to Cover W x H Floor - Calculate the total cost of the tile it would take to cover a floor plan of width and height, using a cost entered by the user.  Mortgage Calculator - Calculate the monthly payments of a fixed-term mortgage over given Nth terms at a given interest rate. Also, figure out how long it will take the user to pay back the loan. For added complexity, add an option for users to select the compounding interval (Monthly, Weekly, Daily, Continually).  Change Return Program - The user enters a cost and then the amount of money given. The program will figure out the change and the number of quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies needed for the change.  Binary to Decimal and Back Converter - Develop a converter to convert a decimal number to binary or a binary number to its decimal equivalent.  Calculator - A simple calculator to do basic operators. Make it a scientific calculator for added complexity.  Unit Converter (temp, currency, volume, mass, and more) - Converts various units between one another. The user enters the type of unit being entered, the type of unit they want to convert to, and then the value. The program will then make the conversion.  Alarm Clock - A simple clock where it plays a sound after X number of minutes/seconds or at a particular time.  Distance Between Two Cities - Calculates the distance between two cities and allows the user to specify a unit of distance. This program may require finding coordinates for the cities like latitude and longitude.  Credit Card Validator - Takes in a credit card number from a common credit card vendor (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discoverer) and validates it to make sure that it is a valid number (look into how credit cards use a checksum).  Tax Calculator - Asks the user to enter a cost and either a country or state tax. It then returns the tax plus the total cost with tax.  Factorial Finder - The Factorial of a positive integer, n, is defined as the product of the sequence n, n-1, n-2, ...1, and the factorial of zero, 0, is defined as being 1. Solve this using both loops and recursion.  Complex Number Algebra - Show addition, multiplication, negation, and inversion of complex numbers in separate functions. (Subtraction and division operations can be made with pairs of these operations.) Print the results for each operation tested.  Happy Numbers - A happy number is defined by the following process. Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers, while those that do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers. Display an example of your output here. Find the first 8 happy numbers.  Number Names - Show how to spell out a number in English. You can use a preexisting implementation or roll your own, but you should support inputs up to at least one million (or the maximum value of your language's default bounded integer type if that's less). Optional:  Support for inputs other than positive integers (like zero, negative integers, and floating-point numbers).  Coin Flip Simulation - Write some code that simulates flipping a single coin however many times the user decides. The code should record the outcomes and count the number of tails and heads.

Also, create a user interface to do a search using that inverted index which returns a list of files that contain the query term/terms. The search index can be in memory.  Text Fizz Buzz - Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print \u201cFizz\u201d instead of the number and for the multiples of five print \u201cBuzz\u201d. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print \u201cFizzBuzz\u201d.  Reverse a String - Enter a string and the program will reverse it and print it out.  Pig Latin - Pig Latin is a game of alterations played in the English language game. To create the Pig Latin form of an English word the initial consonant sound is transposed to the end of the word and an ay is affixed (Ex.:  \\\\\"banana\\\\\" would yield anana-bay). Read Wikipedia for more information on rules.  Count Vowels - Enter a string and the program counts the number of vowels in the text. For added complexity have it report a sum of each vowel found.

Turtle Graphics - This is a common project where you create a floor of 20 x 20 squares. Using various commands you tell a turtle to draw a line on the floor. You have moved forward, left or right, lift or drop the pen, etc. Do a search online for \\\\\"Turtle Graphics\\\\\" for more information. Optional:  Allow the program to read in the list of commands from a file.  GIF Creator A program that puts together multiple images (PNGs, JPGs, TIFFs) to make a smooth GIF that can be exported. Optional:  Make the program convert small video files to GIFs as well.  Security Caesar cipher - Implement a Caesar cipher, both encoding, and decoding. The key is an integer from 1 to 25. This cipher rotates the letters of the alphabet (A to Z). The encoding replaces each letter with the 1st to 25th next letter in the alphabet (wrapping Z to A). So key 2 encrypts \\\\\"HI\\\\\" to \\\\\"JK\\\\\", but key 20 encrypts \\\\\"HI\\\\\" to \\\\\"BC\\\\\". This simple \\\\\"monoalphabetic substitution cipher\\\\\" provides almost no security, because an attacker who has the encoded message can either use frequency analysis to guess the key, or just try all 25 keys.",

India’s size and diversity makes it one of the the most disaster-prone countries in Asia. Large coastal areas in the south suffer from cyclones, while the northern mountainous areas suffer from landslides and floods, and droughts regularly affect the country’s central region. Every year, these result in a huge loss of lives, damage infrastructure, and disrupt vital services. The country’s National Disaster Management Agency (NDMA) has just announced plans to build a national disaster database by 2020, which it hopes will help minimise the impact. With this natural disaster project we are able to give overall funds received to the government of Karnataka. We are to give store all the user information those able who are donating money for floods caused places.our database able to predict the cost management, proper distribution of foods medicines, cloths etc. Finally our database able to give overall money spent to all disaster caused places. In project user can also give feedback for supplied food and cloths that they have received good quality of products. Our web app will  also gives the information about migrated people so that government can easily transfer funds, medicines, foods  to the people.   A major hurdle during the design of the project was displaying the web page of the Natural Disaster Management System.  In our project we are using Django python web framework for web designing. Django is works on the principle of don’t repeat your yourself. For this database we are building dynamic web app. Since we are using python we are also able to plot graph pie charts and we are also using FusionChart. We are also using pandas for arranging data.

This involves reviewing   of already existing software and learning website and derive requirements and   use cases based on the website primary features. The project also encompasses   construction of, sequence diagram, design class diagram, Collaboration diagrams   and other UML modeling diagrams based on the derived use cases. At the end,   high level planning is done for the whole project based on derived use cases by   Agile efforts estimation technique.  Scope   The project will consist of developing personnel scheduling software. Modules of   the website include a login feature, a schedule checker and a schedule planner.   Our innovative 100% web-based Scheduling & Open Shift Management (OSM)   product can help managers efficiently schedule their staff, and also lets the staff   help managers fill open shifts online, see schedules and changes, request time-  off, swap shifts, etc, etc. All schedules, changes, approvals, and alerts not only   happen online in real-time, but also are sent out as emails and text messages to   cell phones. Our Software can cut manager time wasted on scheduling tasks by   50% or more and let them get back to MANAGING! Introduction to HMSS  When workforce includes hundreds of employees, open shifts are inevitable.   Without the right skills-based workforce management tools in place, nurse managers   and staffing managers spend a disproportionate amount of time trying to fill scheduling   gaps. Not only is this inefficient, but it leads to increased costs and reduced employee   satisfaction.  Advantages of having online scheduling system  2.1.   ● Save Money  Reduce premium labor costs by leveraging the most cost-effective, qualified staff   to fill open shifts. Stop wasting time you don’t have on scheduling. Decrease the   time it takes you to create a weekly schedule for your team by over 75 percent   with HMSS.  ● Save Time  Save countless hours using instant communication strategies to fill open shifts.  ● Keep Workers Happy  Increase employee satisfaction by empowering them to choose when they want   to work based on experience, competencies, and skills.  ● Faster, Easier Scheduling  Healthcare staff scheduling has never been easier. Spend minutes instead of   hours organizing shifts for your nurses and other medical staff.  ● Monitor Attendance  Hospital Management System (Personal Scheduling System) – SWE 600 (Fall 2015) Prof.                               Instructors:  Dr. R.   Riehle & Q Asghar   See which employees are coming in late or missing shifts. Send shift reminders   automatically to make sure everyone is on the same page.  ● Give Staff More Independence  Take some work off your own plate with collaborative healthcare staff   scheduling options. Allow your employees to request shift trades and swaps on   their own so you don’t have to micromanage them.  ● Avoid Human Error  Humans make mistakes, but HMSS doesn’t. If you forget to fill a shift or   overbook one, the software immediately notifies you of your error, allowing you   to rectify it right away.  ● Create Perfect Timesheets  Export perfect timesheets to create perfect attendance and work reports. Better   healthcare staff scheduling means easier payroll processing as well.  To deliver the best care possible to patients, we must begin with the best   possible workforce management solution for our staff. With HMSS, we help   control labor costs, minimize compliance risk, improve workforce productivity,   and deliver quality, cost-effective care. Here’s how:   • Physician coverage scheduling enables the effective and equitable deployment   of physicians and other clinician providers – your group, your rules, to build your   schedules  • Advanced staffing supports the safest and most appropriate assignment of   caregiver staff to patients, and balances workload distribution in the best   interests of patients and staff  • Intelligently forecast volume to build optimal schedules helps ensure proper   staff coverage for every shift, every day, across your entire organization  • On-demand visibility with labor analytics controls labor costs and allows   organizations to make evidence-based decisions  • Mobile management supports paperless workflow and employee self-service for   your on-the-go workforce",

The objective of any RFID system is to carry data in suitable transponders, generally known as tags and to retrieve data, by machine readable means, at a suitable time and place and to satisfy particular application needs RFID is one of the most technologies being adopted by both industry and academic world. Modern academic library is a place where millions of books advanced; periodicals, CDs, DVDs and other electronic reading materials are contained. It is a challenge to manage for librarians, managing such type of huge collection. RFID technology is in use since the 1970s. RFID tags can be active, semi-passive and passive. It is a small device that can store information. Passive tags don't have internal batteries. RFID reader is a device that can receive and transmit a radio signal. It is built to encode data stored in the tag's microprocessor. Because of the higher cost, active and semi-passive RFID tags are used for valuable asset tracking. The passive RFID tags are used in RFID library management systems. RFID library management, using RFID tags library, is easy and convenient. A RFID library management system consists of books, each attached with an RFID tag, RFID reader, computer network and software. Library staff handle lending, returning, sorting, tagging etc. of books, using RFID tags in this library system. A person can locate RFID library books marked with a RFID tags, using the RFID reader which identifies and locates the book. When the book is carried to the counter, the library staff can either activate or deactivate the electronic article surveillance bit in the book's tag. If a book is borrowed, then the surveillance bit is deactivated.",

Also searching for suitable blood groups and medicines in an emergency situation is strenuous task for family members which requires maximum time and human effort and sometimes becomes very critical that may cost the life of the patient. Therefore, HealthCare has become an obligatory need of every family. To solve health related problem, we propose a Web based platform to ease the process of finding suitable blood groups from nearby Blood Banks in the area. Also, the application finds generic and its substitute medicine from pharmacies available in the area using Real time Location of the respective user/s through GPS. Subsequently, it reduces paperwork on daily basis of hospital blood banks by maintaining a database that will work in real-time for blood record maintenance. Also, doctors and patients can connect through online chat facility where queries can be solved in real-time and also provide digital prescriptions to them. We also provide a Management Information System to track their daily activities and generate reports for further analysis. ",

//     description:  "Narnia Cruise Lines has several ships and a variety of cruise itineraries, each involving several ports-of-call. The company wants to maintain information on the sailors and other people who currently work on each of its ships. It also wants to keep track of both its past and future cruises and of the passengers who sailed on the former and are booked on the latter. Each ship has many sailors on it including a captain, engineers, doctors and cooks. The unique identifier of each ship is its ship number. Other ship attributes include ship name, weight, year built, and passenger capacity. Each sailor has a unique sailor identification number, as well as a name, date-of-birth, salary, and nationality. Some of the sailors are in supervising positions, supervising several other sailors and earn 20% more than sailors. Each sailor reports to just one supervisor. The base salary of sailors is $50,000 and the captain gets $300,000. Engineers and cooks make $80,000. A cruise is identified by a unique cruise serial number. Other cruise descriptors include a sailing date, a return date, and a departure port (which is also the cruise’s ending point.) Clearly, a cruise involves exactly one ship and over time a ship sails on many cruises. Each cruise stops at one or usually several ports-of-call, each of which is normally host to many cruises, over time. In addition, the company wants to maintain information about ports that it has not as yet used in its cruises but may use in the future. A port is identified by its name and the country that it is in. Other information about a port includes its population, whether a passport is required for the passengers to disembark there, and its current docking fee, which is assumed to be $20,000 if the ship’s weight is less than 30000 tons, $50,000 if between 30000-50000 tons and $100,000 if the ship’s weight is over 50000 tons. A cruise typically has many passengers on it and on average a ticket costs $900. Passenger information includes a unique passenger number, name, home address, nationality, date-of- birth, money they paid for joining the cruise and moneySpentOnCruise (calculated by totalling amount of money spent by the passenger on-board cruise). Hoping for return business, the company wants to keep track of passengers that may have sailed on several of its cruises (and/or may be booked for a future cruise.) For a person to be of interest to the company, he or she must have sailed on or be booked on at least one of the company’s cruises. The company wants to keep track of how much money each passenger paid for each of their cruises, as well as their satisfaction rating of the cruise, if it has been completed.  1|Page Tasks Design a complete object-oriented system for cruise management based on the above specification. Your system must in the least provide the following features through a console based menu system:  1. Create a cruise with ship, sailors and ports randomly. 2. Add passengers to a cruise. Both manual and random options must be given. 3. Provide reports on the following areas:  a. Revenue generated from the cruise passengers by nationality and age b. Details of all Sailors that worked on a cruise and the total cost of paying their salaries and the total cost of docking at different ports c. List of passengers with their details sorted by moneySpentOnCruise d. Cruise evaluation by passengers (assume each passenger completes a 5 question survey at the end of the cruise and generate/store random responses) e. Did the ship make a profit? Use the expenses and earnings from passengers. 4. Information about the cruise including employees, passengers, ports-of-call, and money spent by employees on the cruise must be stored in text files once the cruise is over. Note that this project is open-ended and therefore you are free to implement any additional functionality that you think is necessary based on your design. Most important requirement is the application of OBJECT-ORIENTED DESIGN principles.",

The goal here is to compute the mobility of electrons and holes in a multiscale model via kinetic Monte Carlo simulations using bimolecular charge transfer rates based on the Marcus theory using Marcus, Jortner or Weiss-Dorsey rates.  Therefore, accurate hopping rates between neighbouring molecules are mandatory, depending on the internal and outer-sphere reorganization energies, site-energy differences, charge transfer integrals, and external driving forces.  One can combine intermolecular and intramolecular charge transfer in amorphous materials.  The hopping rates are then fed into the kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, which allow to monitor the charge dynamics in the system as well as to get ensemble averages of the occupation probability, charge carrier mobility, electronic fluxes and pathways of minimal local resistance. Hence, the multiscale model links the microscopic structure to macroscopic observables.",
